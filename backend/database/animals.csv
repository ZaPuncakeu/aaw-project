It can be found in southeastern Canada, through the eastern United States from Maine to Minnesota to Texas, New Mexico, southern Arizona, southern California, and south through Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala. It is also an introduced species in a few locations such as Bermuda and Hawaii. Its habitat includes woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and wetlands.

The northern cardinal is a mid-sized songbird with a body length of 21–23 cm (8.3–9.1 in). It has a distinctive crest on the head and a mask on the face which is black in the male and gray in the female. The male is a vibrant red, while the female is a reddish olive color. The northern cardinal is mainly granivorous, but also feeds on insects and fruit. The male behaves territorially, marking out his territory with song. During courtship, the male feeds seed to the female beak-to-beak. A clutch of three to four eggs is laid, and two to four clutches are produced each year. It was once prized as a pet, but its sale as a cage bird was banned in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.","Northern cardinals are common throughout central and eastern North America, and south from Florida and Mexico down to Belize and Guatemala. This species has also been introduced to Bermuda, California, and Hawaii. They inhabit woodland edges, streamside thickets, wetlands, shrublands, gardens, and vegetation near houses in suburban and urban areas.","This species is not migratory but is a year-round resident within its range. During the day, these birds are active, especially in the morning and evening. In winter they feed in large flocks of as many as 60 to 70, mainly in open thickets on the ground, but they also forage in bushes and trees. In winter, most will roost and flock together. Males are very territorial and will defend their territory from other males. If they see their own reflection, they may attempt to fight this intruder. These birds primarily use physical displays and vocalizations to communicate. Both male and female cardinals sing, with beautiful, loud whistled phrases, sounding like ""whacheer whacheer"" and ""whoit whoit whoit"". They sing for courtship and to defend territories. ""Chips"" is their contact call or alarm. They also use many visual displays for signaling alarm, including ""tail-flicks"" and lifting and lowering their crest.","Northern cardinals are herbivores (granivores); they eat the seeds of grasses and corn, fruit (grapes and berries), buds, sunflower seeds, and insects.

The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are home to 99.7% of the population. This small (for its family) gull-like albatross is the second-most common seabird in the Hawaiian Islands, with an estimated population of 1.18 million birds, and is currently expanding (or possibly re-expanding) its range to new islands. The Laysan albatross was first described as Diomedea immutabilis by Lionel Walter Rothschild, in 1893, on the basis of a specimen from Laysan Island.
The graceful glide of this bird among the waves and winds of the Pacific Ocean is a marvelous sight. The Laysan albatross is an expert soarer and can travel hundreds of miles in a day with scarcely a wing beat. Its name is due to being the only specimen that lives on Laysan Island. It nests on islands in the tropical Pacific, but will feed in Japan, California or the Aleutian Islands. In 1983 the famous British zoologist Lionel Walter Rothschild illustrated this species as Diomedia Immutabilis.","The Laysan albatross ranges over the northern Pacific Ocean from around the latitude of Costa Rica across to the Aleutian Islands and the southern Bering Sea. It spends most of its time on the open sea, spanning these tropical waters. It nests on open sandy or grassy expanses of islands, with 94% of breeding pairs on Laysan Island and Midway Atoll, as well as on other small Hawaiian Islands, the bigger islands of Oahu and Kauai, and a few sites off Japan and Mexico.","The classic behavior of an albatross is dynamic soaring, with very infrequent wing beats. It uses the speed and direction changes of wind at different heights to be able to fly great distances with only very slight changes to its wing position. On the ground it walks ponderously and usually has to run into the wind along the ground to take off. This species spends much time at sea, circling around for many years. Only during the mating period do they remain on the ground. They often “crash-land”, rolling head over heels. During the night they settle on the water to feed. Normally quiet and solitary when at sea, they may gather in large flocks to feed on discarded fish from factory trawlers. These birds seize food at the surface of the water and by shallow diving. Aside from when breeding, they do not have a territory or set home. They return year after year to the same breeding place.","The Laysan albatross is carnivore (molluscivore), it eats mainly squid and other aquatic prey including fish, crustaceans, and coelenterates and other invertebrates.","Carnivore",4,51,"""12,13""","""15,16""","laysan-albatross","""1396,946"""

Although related to the other North Pacific albatrosses, it also exhibits behavioural and morphological links to the albatrosses of the Southern Ocean. It was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas from skins collected by Georg Wilhelm Steller (after whom its other common name is derived). Once common, it was brought to the edge of extinction by the trade in feathers, but with protection efforts underway since the 1950s, the species is in the process of recovering with an increasing population trend. Its breeding range, however, remains small.
The largest out of three species of albatross that occur in the North Pacific Ocean, the Short-tailed albatross is best distinguished by its large, bubblegum-pink beak with a bluish tip. Named because of their short, white tails with a black bar at its end, these seabirds have blackish brown feathers to start with, and legs that are pale pinkish-yellow. The feathers turn white as they mature, leaving only black edges on the wings and just a little of the dull orange color on the bird’s crown and nape.","This seabird was once widely distributed throughout the North Pacific Ocean near Taiwan and Japan. Currently it nests on Minami-kojima and Torishima in the Senkaku Islands of Japan and is found along the coasts of China, South Korea, Alaska, eastern Russia, in the north west of the Hawaiian Islands and North America’s western coasts. This pelagic species primarily inhabits open oceans. The birds build their nests on the bare ground of islands, in locations that are surrounded by medium to high cliffs.","The Short-tailed albatross feeds at night or in the early morning and when it is competing for food it is usually the dominant one among other seabirds like the Black-footed albatross and the Northern fulmar, and other species that congregate around fishing vessels. This bird is usually silent when at sea, but when engaged in competing for food, it makes a number of sounds including croaking, shrieking and gargling. They use rapid bill-clattering, which is like a rattling sound, in courtship and for threat displays against intruders. This species migrates in the autumn, generally reaching the nesting colonies by October. Non-breeding birds and failed breeding pairs depart the colonies in winter and spring and range around the North Pacific Ocean. The successful breeders remain with their nesting colony until May or June.","The Short-tailed albatross is carnivore and eats aquatic prey such as fish, squid and shrimps.

They are found in coniferous and mixed coniferous forests across much of Canada, from Alaska to Nova Scotia, and south to the mountains of North Carolina and west to Utah in the United States. They are light brown with pale underparts and grow to a length of 25 to 37 cm (10 to 15 in). They are proficient gliders but uncoordinated walkers on the ground. They feed on a variety of plant material as well as tree sap, fungi, insects, carrion, bird eggs and nestlings. They mostly breed once a year in a cavity lined with lichen or other soft material. Except when they have young, they change nests frequently, and in winter a number of individuals may huddle together in a shared nest. Unlike most members of their family, flying squirrels are strictly nocturnal.
The Northern flying squirrel is a North American rodent with long whiskers and a flattened tail. As a matter of fact, this mammal doesn't fly, but glides, using the fold of skin, found between its wrists and ankles. When gliding, this crease of skin extends, allowing the animal to 'fly', whereas the tail acts as a rudder. The Northern flying squirrel is a nocturnal creature that lives in forested areas. It has brown fur on the upper parts, which fades to buffy-white on the belly.","Endemic to North America, the northern flying squirrel is widely distributed throughout much of the continent form from Alaska, eastwards to Canada and the eastern provinces, southwards to interior regions of the United States, reaching southern California. The preferred habitat of this species is an area with an abundance of conifer trees. This rodent occurs in large numbers in deciduous and mixed coniferous/deciduous forests. Other suitable habitats include areas, dominated by spruce, fir, and mixed hemlocks; beech maple forests; areas with abundant growth of white spruce and birch, alternating with aspen groves.","Northern flying squirrels are social animals. They often form groups of 8 individuals, typically including matures squirrels and juveniles. In addition, multiple individuals have been known to live in the same nest. During the winter months, these squirrels gather into same-sex units in order to keep warm. Northern flying squirrels are strictly nocturnal animals. They have two periods of activity during the day: one occurs an hour after sunset, lasting around 2 hours, whereas the other begins 2 hours before sunrise, lasting for 1.5 - 2 hours. During the year, each individual may have several dens. The winter dens of this species are usually cavities in conifer trees. Since they don't hibernate, multiple individuals may live in a single den during this period to conserve heat. These rodents are one of the most aerodynamically sophisticated gliding mammals. They are able to glide for as long as 5 - 45 meters at a time (20 average), though flights as long as 90 meters have been recorded. Northern flying squirrels are terrestrial feeders, spending a lot of time looking for food. Primary forms of communication include vocalizations, scent, and touch. The most commonly heard calls of this squirrel are soft, low chirping sounds and a cluck, which is emitted when the animal is feeling danger.","Northern flying squirrels are herbivores (granivores) and generally feed upon nuts, acorns, fungi, and lichens.

It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.

The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, Western Asia and northern parts of India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.

One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.
The lion is a big wild cat with short, tawny-colored fur and white underparts. The long tail ends with a black tuft. The lions display sexual dimorphism with males, having their distinctive manes, ranging in color from black to blond. They develop their manes at the age of 3 years. Meanwhile, manes of those, living in open areas, are notably fuller. The mane makes the lion look much larger than it is, helping the animal intimidate the opponent during confrontations with other lions as well the Spotted Hyena, which is the animal's primary competitor throughout its range. Young lions have a grayish coat, covered with brown markings, which then disappear by the age of 3 months. However, lions in eastern Africa tend to retain these spots on their stomach.","Presently, lions are distributed across the sub-Saharan region of Africa and in Gir Forest in Gujarat state of India . They prefer grassy plains and savannas, scrub bordering rivers, and open woodlands with bushes. They rarely enter closed forests. Remnant populations can also be found in the tropical moist forests in West Africa and montane forests in East Africa.","Lions can be active at any time of the day but their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing and grooming. Most hunting often takes place at dusk. Apart from that African lions spend much of their time resting. They rest in order to save energy, in the absence of prey, or to escape the midday heat. African lions are highly social animals, gathering in groups or prides, which include up to 3 male lions and multiple lionesses with their young. Prides are defended by males, who patrol and mark the territory. However, there's harsh competition between males for the territory and position in the pride. In a case, if another male overcomes the leading male of the pride, he usually kills all cubs, sired by the previous male. Meanwhile, males do not tend to hunt due to their slow speed and eye-catching appearance. Instead, hunting is left to females of the pride, who hunt in groups, cooperating with each other during their hunting trips. The females are excellent hunters: they are faster and more agile than males, able to hunt down animals that are much bigger and faster than them.","Lions are generalist hypercarnivores. They primarily hunt on zebras, antelopes, gazelles, deer, buffalos, young giraffes, warthogs, wildebeest, young elephants, less frequently – on hares and birds. Lions can also scavenge on carrion when the opportunity arises; they scavenge animals dead from natural causes such as disease or those that were killed by other predators such as hyenas.","Carnivore",6,25,"""1200,2490""","""140,250""","lion","""1421,947"""

It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range, and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.
Tigers are the biggest cats in the world. Their coat is a reddish-orange coat and there are vertical black stripes on the shoulders and flanks that vary in size, spacing, and length. Some subspecies have fur that is paler, some being almost completely white with either dark brown or black stripes along their flanks and shoulders. The muzzle, throat, chest, belly, and underside of the limbs are white or light. Above the eyes, of these beautiful animals, there is a white color that extends to the cheeks. On the back of their ears, there is a white spot. Their tail is reddish-orange in color and ringed by several dark bands.","Tigers live in South Asia and Southeast Asia, and also the Russian Far East and China. They inhabit pine and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, where riparian forests provide food and water. On the Indian subcontinent, these animals live mainly in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, moist evergreen forests, tropical dry forests, and the swamp forests of the Sundarbans. Tigers can also range from lowland peat swamp forests to rugged montane forests and in tall grass jungles.","Tigers are solitary animals, except during the mating season and when the females give birth. They like to be mostly alone, roaming their huge territories in search of food. They are territorial, marking their territory with scratch marks on trees. These animals are most active during the night when their prey is most active. They can, however, be active at any time. They prefer to hunt within dense vegetation, using routes where they are able to move quietly. They knock prey onto the ground with the weight of their body and kill their catch by biting their neck. They are very good swimmers and often bathe in ponds, lakes, and rivers, thus keeping cool in the heat of the day; they can even kill prey while swimming. Tigers communicate through facial expressions and vocally. The most common facial expression includes the ""defense threat"", where an individual bares its teeth, flattens its ears and its pupils enlarge. Like other members of their family, tigers roar, particularly in aggressive situations, during the mating season, or when making a kill. They will also chuff which is a soft, low-frequency snorting similar to purring in smaller cats. Other vocal communications include grunts, woofs, snarls, miaows, hisses, and growls.","All tigers are carnivores, eating mainly sambar deer, water buffalo, wild pigs, and antelope.

It is recognizable by its black-and-white patterned body. A cosmopolitan species, orcas can be found in all of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.

Orcas have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. Orcas are apex predators, as they have no natural predators. They are highly social; some populations are composed of very stable matrilineal family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species. Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations of animal culture.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses the orca's conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more orca types are separate species. Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), capture for marine mammal parks, and conflicts with human fisheries. In late 2005, the southern resident orcas, which swim in British Columbia and Washington waters, were placed on the U.S. Endangered Species list.

Wild orcas are not considered a threat to humans, and no fatal attack on humans has ever been documented. There have been cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks. Orcas feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, and their reputation in different cultures ranges from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.
The Killer whale or orca is one of the toothed whales and the largest member of the dolphin family. They have long, round bodies with big dorsal fins in the middle of their back. Their bodies are black with white patches underneath and near their eyes. These distinctive patterns help to camouflage them when they are searching for food. In newborns, the white parts of their body have an orange tinge.","","Killer whales are highly social animals; they are active during the day and sleep at night. They travel in pods of between 3 and 50 individuals, led by females. They establish social hierarchies. Individuals in pods are usually related to each other and consist of about 20% adult males, 20% calves, with the rest being females and young males. They have limited dispersal from their maternal pod. Killer whales may share prey and seldom leave the pod for longer than a few hours. Pod members learn skills through apprenticeships, such as hunting and parenting. Killer whales are very vocal animals and communicate with each other using whistles and clicks via echolocation, and through physical behavior such as breaching, slapping their tail or flippers, and ‘spyhopping’, when they lift their head above the water.","Killer whales are highly social animals; they are active during the day and sleep at night.
